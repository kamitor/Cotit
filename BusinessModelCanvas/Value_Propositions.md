Market Size and Growth: The European 3PL market was valued at approximately €174 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 4% from 2021 to 2026. The Netherlands, being a logistics hub, captures a significant portion of this market. Assuming even a conservative 5% market share, this presents a potential annual revenue opportunity in the billions of Euros for CoTiT.

Cost Savings and Efficiency Gains for Clients: With our innovative supply chain finance solutions and warehouse management technologies, we can significantly reduce operational costs for 3PL providers. Studies suggest that implementing advanced supply chain solutions can reduce inventory holding costs by up to 25% and increase inventory accuracy to 99%, leading to substantial cost savings. For a medium-sized 3PL provider handling €50 million in inventory annually, a 25% reduction in inventory costs can translate to savings of €12.5 million, showcasing the direct financial benefit of our services.

High Profit Margins in Supply Chain Finance: Supply chain finance is a rapidly growing segment, with global volumes expected to reach €2.2 trillion by 2023. By offering tailored financial services to 3PL providers, CoTiT can tap into this lucrative market. The margins in supply chain finance can be significantly high, often ranging between 2% to 5% of the financed amount. Assuming a conservative average financing deal size of €1 million and a 3% margin, each deal could generate €30,000 in profit, with the potential for multiple deals per client.

Investment in Sustainable and Efficient Logistics: The Dutch government and EU regulations are increasingly focusing on sustainability and efficiency in logistics. CoTiT's commitment to integrating these aspects into our solutions not only aligns with regulatory trends but also opens up opportunities for government incentives, subsidies, and partnerships. For instance, the Dutch government has set aside significant funds for sustainability initiatives, with grants and tax benefits available for companies innovating in this space.

Strategic Positioning in a Key Logistics Hub: The Netherlands is home to the Port of Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe, and a key logistics and distribution hub. This strategic location offers unparalleled access to European markets. By focusing on 3PL providers in this region, CoTiT stands to benefit from the high volume of goods flowing through the Netherlands, estimated at over 650 million tonnes annually. Capturing even a small fraction of the logistics activities related to this volume presents a significant revenue opportunity.
