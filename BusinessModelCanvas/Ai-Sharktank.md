Strategic Acquisition by a Global Logistics Provider: COTIT envisions becoming an attractive acquisition target for leading global logistics providers seeking to enhance their technology and supply chain management capabilities. We aim to create a compelling value proposition that aligns with potential acquirers' growth strategies and complements their existing operations. By building strategic partnerships and showcasing our innovation, we position ourselves for a successful acquisition that rewards our investors.

IPO (Initial Public Offering): COTIT recognizes the potential of going public to access public capital markets and accelerate our expansion. We are committed to building a robust financial track record and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. As we continue to demonstrate strong performance and growth, an IPO becomes a strategic avenue to provide liquidity to our investors and raise additional capital for scaling our operations.

Private Equity Partnership: To support our growth ambitions, COTIT actively explores partnerships with private equity firms specializing in the technology and logistics sectors. We aim to secure an equity investment that enables us to expand our reach and capabilities while offering partial liquidity to our existing investors. This partnership ensures the infusion of expertise and resources required for our continued success.

Management Buyout (MBO): COTIT's management team, deeply committed to the company's vision and potential, may consider executing a management buyout in collaboration with external investors or financing partners. This approach allows our current management team to take ownership of the company, ensuring continuity in leadership and driving long-term growth.

Secondary Market Sales: COTIT acknowledges the importance of providing liquidity to our investors. We actively facilitate secondary market sales, creating a platform for interested parties to trade COTIT shares. This option allows investors to access liquidity while maintaining their ownership stakes and supporting our ongoing journey.

Earn-Out Agreements: COTIT is open to structuring exit agreements with earn-out provisions, where a portion of the sale price is contingent on achieving post-acquisition performance milestones. This approach aligns the interests of our management team and investors, incentivizing us to maximize value even after an acquisition.

Strategic Partnerships: Building strategic partnerships with prominent industry players remains a key focus for COTIT. These partnerships can lead to collaborations, joint ventures, or potential acquisition discussions. By fostering these relationships, we create a pathway for future exit opportunities while enhancing our growth prospects.

Liquidation (As a Last Resort): While not our preferred option, COTIT acknowledges that liquidation could be considered in extreme circumstances. We will diligently explore all other exit strategies before contemplating liquidation, ensuring that investors' interests are protected to the greatest extent possible.
